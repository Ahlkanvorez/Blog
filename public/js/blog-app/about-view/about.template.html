    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p style="font-size:1em">I am a senior at the University of Texas at Austin, majoring in Mathematics with a minor in Chinese language. I started out as a Computer Science & Mathematics double major, and still have strong Computer Science interests (resulting in things like the creation of this blog), so if you're interested in my programming projects, check out my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Ahlkanvorez">Github</a>.</p>
    <p style="font-size:1em">I'm also quite interested in language, particularly Latin and Classical Greek, as well as Chinese, and do a fare bit of reading in history, philosophy, and theology. </p>

        <li><b><a target="_blank" href="#">Automated Equation Solving</a></b> - Originally a project I wrote in the Racket dialect of Scheme, and am currently working on rewriting in Java, which used rewrite-rules to transform patterns, with application in solving equations symbolically, proving theorems, etc. If you're interested in seeing the code, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Ahlkanvorez/pattern-rewriting">here is the Github link.</a></li>
        <li><b><a target="_blank" href="#!/article-list/Technology">Java Algorithms</a></b> - A collection of algorithm implementations which I am working on writing and improving, largely for instructive use, ranging from sorts to data-structures, and even mathematical algorithms.

    <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt>Programming</dt>
        <dd>I have been programming in one language or another since 2011, mostly in Java and Javascript, a good deal in Lisp (common-lisp & scheme), some in Python, and a small amount of Perl. I vastly prefer working in Javascript, but feel comfortable in any language with good functional programming support, or at least good object-oriented programming support.</dd>
        <dt>MEAN stack: MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS</dt>
        <dd>This blog is written using a MEAN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS) stack. I consider myself moderately proficient in MEAN stack development, and it is my preferred environment for web development.</dd>
        <dt>HTML, CSS, & Jade</dt>
        <dd>I designed the web-pages in all of my web projects, including this blog, and consider myself proficient in HTML and CSS. The base templates use Bootstrap for a reliable and consistent adaptive layout which works on mobile as well as more traditional devices.</dd>
        <dt>Typing</dt>
        <dd>I can consistently type between 100 and 110 words per minute when copying text.</dd>
