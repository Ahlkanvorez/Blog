      The Good, the Beautiful, the Simple, the Sublime, the Just &mdash; these things all transcend their
      examples, and when cultivated together by minds in discussion cast light on what it means to have
      wisdom, a good education, and a good life. I make no claim to having any of these, but do hope that by
      writing articles on various subjects related to these I may learn something of each of them and make it
      apparent to anyone reading.

      Classics, Mathematics, Philosophy, and Theology are the primary subjects of most of the articles I will
      write, although anything Computer Science related and any of the Liberal Arts are potential subjects.
      I plan to discuss my own translations of ancient texts in Latin and Greek, both in terms of their style
      to see their beauty, and their content &amp; implications to consider the underlying thought; and, although
      I have chosen not to allow comments for the time being, I heartily welcome discussion on
      <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/RobertMitchel_l">Twitter</a> if you enjoy something I have
      written.

      In case you're curious who the author is behind the articles, I'm a graduate of the University of Texas
      at Austin in the class of 2017, with a Bachelors of Science &amp; Arts in Mathematics, and a minor in
      Chinese language (Here's a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hrodebert.com/resources/resume.pdf">link
      to my Resume</a>). My interests are hopefully already apparent; nevertheless, when I'm not busy reading
      Greek or Latin, I'm usually either working on a coding project (about which I will occasionally write),
      or giving my mind some time to relax by reading poetry, other literature, or perhaps enjoying a good
      video game (The Elder Scrolls series is particularly good). I make it no secret that I am Presbyterian,
      specifically a member of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.opc.org/">OPC</a>, but in writing on
      such varied topics I will almost never be writing dogmatically &mdash; my goal in writing is to learn
      and understand, not to be one more website that only pumps out its own viewpoint. All of that being
      said, I hope you enjoy something I write, and if you do, let me know!
