		<dt>Programming</dt>
		<dd>I have been programming in one language or another since 2011, mostly in Java and Javascript, a good deal in Lisp (common-lisp & scheme), some in Python, and a small amount of Perl. I vastly prefer working in Javascript, but feel comfortable in any language with good functional programming support, or at least good object-oriented programming support.</dd>
		<dt>MEAN stack: MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS</dt>
		<dd>This blog is written using a MEAN stack, and unless otherwise indicated, so are my other web projects. I consider myself moderately proficient in MEAN stack development, and it is my preferred environment for web development.</dd>
		<dt>HTML, CSS, & Jade</dt>
		<dd>I designed the webpages in all of my web projects, including this blog, and consider myself proficient in HTML and CSS. The base templates use Boostrap for a reliable and consistent adaptive layout which works on mobile as well as more traditional devices.</dd>
		<dt>Typing</dt>
		<dd>I can consistently type between 100 and 110 words per minute when copying text.</dd>
