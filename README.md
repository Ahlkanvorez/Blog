# Blog
My personal blog, written on the MEAN stack, using Angular4 and Typescript for the front-end,
Webpack2 for code conglomeration, minification, and separation, and Jasmine for back-end tests.

I originally wrote the front-end in AngularJS, but have since migrated to Angular4 and Typescript
(although at the time of writing this Readme, the admin panel is still written in AngularJS). The
original AngularJS code, as well as the Angular4 code in Typescript, are both still in the repository
as subdirectories of the public/ folder; viz. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Ahlkanvorez/Blog/tree/master/public/angularJS">public/angularJS</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Ahlkanvorez/Blog/tree/master/public/Angular2">public/Angular2</a>.
