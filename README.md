# Blog
<p>
My personal blog, written on the MEAN stack, using Jasmine for tests, and Gulp to prepare a single file for the site to request. While it is finished in the sense that it functions as a blog, I do plan to continually update and improve both the code-base and the web-page, as time allows.
